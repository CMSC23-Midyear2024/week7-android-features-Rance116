## Code Description

contact list with remove and add function

## Things you did in the code

I used the functin on pub.dev about flutter_contact, after filling the neccessary information, it store the data in a contact class then insert the contact on the contact list. When viewing a specific contact you can remove it with the remove contact button

## Challenges encountered

fitting the picture on the screen when using clipoval so I used containre to limit the size
